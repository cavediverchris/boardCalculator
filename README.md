# Project Background
I started designing a custom desk shape that would fit in a cubby area that I could use for my computer. My plan was to make it out of hardwood that would be laminated together in order to make the final shape.

# Board Coverage Calculator
I needed to work out how many wooden boards I would need to cover an area and this calculator enabled me to work out how many pieces of wood I would need to buy.

# Project Structure
In the High-Level Scripts folder, there are two key scripts. These are outlined in detail below.

## Board Length Calculator


## Board Price
This script is a wrapper for the Board Length Calculator. It will drive the Board Length Calculator function with the width(s) of the board(s) available, it will then work out how many boards and what length is required. Knowing the length of material the final price can be calculated which is plotted to help visualise an optimal price point.
